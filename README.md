Problem Statement: Predicting Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) Using Machine Learning
Background:
Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a progressive condition characterized by a gradual loss of kidney function over time. If left undiagnosed and untreated, CKD can lead to severe complications, including kidney failure, cardiovascular diseases, and increased mortality rates. Early detection and intervention are crucial to managing the disease effectively and improving patient outcomes.

Traditional diagnostic methods rely on blood and urine tests, which can be costly, time-consuming, and may not always be accessible in underdeveloped healthcare systems. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we can develop a predictive model that identifies individuals at risk of CKD based on easily available medical and demographic data.

Objective:
The primary goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict the likelihood of CKD in individuals using clinical and lifestyle-related features. This model aims to assist healthcare professionals in early detection, enabling timely medical intervention and improving patient care.
