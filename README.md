# Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) Prediction

## Overview
Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a progressive condition that affects kidney function over time. Early detection is crucial for preventing severe health complications. This project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of CKD based on medical and demographic data.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains clinical and lifestyle-related features, including blood test results, urine analysis, and demographic information. The dataset is cleaned and preprocessed before training the model.

## Objective
- Develop a predictive model for CKD detection.
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand key risk factors.
- Evaluate various machine learning models to achieve optimal performance.
- Provide insights to assist healthcare professionals in early diagnosis.

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values
   - Feature engineering
   - Normalization and encoding
   
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Understanding data distribution
   - Identifying correlations
   - Visualizing key features

3. **Model Building**
   - Implementing machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)
   - Hyperparameter tuning
   - Model evaluation using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and ROC-AUC

4. **Model Deployment (Optional)**
   - Deploying the model as a web application
   - Creating an API for real-world use

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib & Seaborn

## Results
- The model provides predictions on CKD likelihood.
- Performance metrics and feature importance are analyzed.
- Further improvements can be made through additional data and model tuning.
